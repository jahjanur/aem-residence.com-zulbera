# Deploying to Hostinger Node.js – Step-by-step

This guide assumes you already have a Hostinger account with **Node.js** hosting enabled (VPS or a plan that supports Node.js applications).

---

## If you see "Unsupported framework or invalid project structure"

Hostinger supports **Express, Vite, React**, and a few other JS frameworks. This project uses all three; the **root** `package.json` now lists them as dependencies so Hostinger’s detector recognizes the repo when you select the **repo root** as Application Root.

**Use repo root (recommended):**

- **Application Root:** leave as the **repo root** (the folder with `package.json`, `apps/`, `packages/`).
- **Build command:** `npm ci && npm run build:zulbera` (or `npm run build:deploy` if not using `/zulbera`).
- **Start command:** `npm run start` (or leave empty if Hostinger uses the entry file to start).
- **Entry file:** If Hostinger requires an entry file, set it to **`server.js`** (root-level file that starts the API).
- Set **environment variables** in the Hostinger Node.js app panel.

**If the error still appears**, set **Application Root** to **`apps/api`** so Hostinger sees the Express app directly:

- **Application Root:** `apps/api`
- **Start command:** `node dist/index.js`
- Run the full build from the **repo root** first (e.g. via SSH or deploy script):  
  `npm ci && npm run build:zulbera`  
  so that `apps/api/dist` and `apps/api/public` exist.
- Set environment variables in the Hostinger panel.

## Codebase summary (for deployment)

| Item | Details |
|------|--------|
| **Structure** | Monorepo: `apps/api` (Express + TypeScript), `apps/web` (Vite + React), `packages/shared` |
| **Runtime** | Single Node.js process: API serves REST at `/auth`, `/orders`, `/products`, etc., and serves the built React SPA from `apps/api/public` |
| **Database** | Prisma; local dev uses SQLite. **Production:** use Hostinger MySQL (recommended) or keep SQLite on server |
| **Build** | From repo root: `npm ci` → `npm run build:deploy` (builds shared + api + web, then copies `apps/web/dist` → `apps/api/public`) |
| **Start** | From repo root: `npm run start` (runs `node dist/index.js` in `apps/api`) |
| **Node** | `engines.node": ">=18"` in root `package.json` |

---

## 1. Prepare the project locally

- Ensure Hostinger has **Node.js 18+** available (check in the Node.js app panel).
- If using **MySQL** (recommended on Hostinger):
  - In Hostinger, create a MySQL database and user; note the host, database name, user, and password.
  - In `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma` set `provider = "mysql"` and keep `url = env("DATABASE_URL")`.
  - Create a MySQL-compatible migration or use `npx prisma db push` for initial schema (see DEPLOYMENT.md).

---

## 2. Upload the project to Hostinger

- Upload the **entire repo** (or push to Git and clone on the server) so the Hostinger **Application Root** is the folder that contains:
  - Root `package.json` (with workspaces and `build:deploy` / `start` scripts)
  - `apps/` (api + web)
  - `packages/` (shared)

- Do **not** rely on uploading `apps/api/public`: it is generated by `build:deploy` and is in `.gitignore`. You will run the build on the server (or in CI) so that `apps/api/public` exists after deploy.

---

## 3. Install dependencies and build on the server

SSH into the server (or use Hostinger’s “Run script” / terminal if available) and run from the **Application Root** (repo root):

```bash
npm ci
npm run build:deploy
```

- `build:deploy` builds shared, api, and web, then copies the web build into `apps/api/public`.
- After this, `apps/api/public` exists and the API will serve the SPA in production.

---

## 4. Environment variables (Hostinger Node.js app settings)

Set these in the Node.js app’s **Environment** (or `.env` in Application Root, depending on Hostinger):

| Variable | Example / notes |
|----------|------------------|
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` |
| `PORT` | Port Hostinger assigns (e.g. `4000`); use the one shown in the panel. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | MySQL: `mysql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST/DATABASE` or SQLite: `file:./prisma/dev.db` (ensure `apps/api/prisma` is writable). |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Long random string (e.g. from `openssl rand -hex 32`). |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | For same-origin leave unset or set to your app URL, e.g. `https://aem-residence.com`. |
| `BASE_PATH` | When the app is at **aem-residence.com/zulbera**, set `BASE_PATH=/zulbera` and use build command `npm run build:zulbera` (see below). |

For **same-origin** (one domain for API + frontend):

- Do **not** set `VITE_API_BASE` when building (or set to empty). The React app will call the API on the same host (`/auth`, `/orders`, etc.).

**Serving at aem-residence.com/zulbera (one of three sites on the same server):** Set `BASE_PATH=/zulbera` in the Node app environment. Use **Build command** `npm run build:zulbera` (from repo root) so the frontend and API use the `/zulbera` base path. Users will open **https://aem-residence.com/zulbera** to use this app.

---

## 5. Start command (Hostinger panel)

- **Application Root:** folder that contains root `package.json` and `apps/` (repo root).
- **Start command:**  
  `npm run start`  

This runs the API; in production the API also serves the React app from `apps/api/public`.

If Hostinger requires the process to run from a subfolder:

- **Application Root:** `apps/api`
- **Start command:** `node dist/index.js`  
  You must still run `npm run build:deploy` from the **repo root** so that `apps/api/public` exists and is up to date.

---

## 6. Database (first deploy)

- **MySQL:** Set `DATABASE_URL` in the Node app, then from repo root run:
  - `npx prisma migrate deploy`  
  or, if you use `db push` for initial schema:
  - `npx prisma db push`
  - Optionally: `npm run db:seed`
- **SQLite:** Set `DATABASE_URL=file:./prisma/dev.db`, ensure `apps/api/prisma` is writable, then run `npm run db:migrate` (and optionally `npm run db:seed`) from repo root.

---

## 7. Session and writable paths

- Sessions are stored on disk in `apps/api/prisma/sessions` (session-file-store). Ensure this directory exists and is writable by the Node process.
- If you use SQLite, `apps/api/prisma` must be writable for the DB file.

---

## 8. Quick checklist

- [ ] Node 18+ on Hostinger
- [ ] Repo uploaded/cloned; Application Root = repo root (or `apps/api` with start `node dist/index.js`)
- [ ] `npm ci` and `npm run build:deploy` run from repo root
- [ ] `NODE_ENV=production`, `PORT`, `DATABASE_URL`, `SESSION_SECRET` set; `CORS_ORIGIN` if needed
- [ ] Prisma: `provider = "mysql"` and migrations (or `db push`) + optional seed
- [ ] Start command: `npm run start` (from repo root) or `node dist/index.js` (from `apps/api`)
- [ ] `apps/api/prisma/sessions` (and `prisma` for SQLite) writable
